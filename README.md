Bite My Shiny Metal API Project for 67-373 Spring 2015.

Still in development.

To run, migrate with **rake db:migrate** and populate with **rake db:populate** to get an **admin** user, some approvers, some requesters, and data for their keys.

**Note to team:** For any comments that need to be returned to later, mark with **FIXME** so we can find them.
